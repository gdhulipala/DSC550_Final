# DSC550_Final
Final Term Project


## Notes Related to Data File

The dataset used here is categorized-comments.jsonl which is about 500 MB in size. Hence not able to upload in the data folder
as the git hub is throwing an error that the size is greater than 100 MB. However, the WorkflowQueue has a variable "datafilepath" for file path. If the variable is replaced with the right folder path the code should execute and generate the report

## Notes About The Project

The code is split between Workflows and WorkflowQueue. In the workflows all the independent tasks were defined. 
On the otherhand WorkflowQueue handles all the tasks together. This will furthur generate the markdown report that
includes information about accuracy

# Overview
